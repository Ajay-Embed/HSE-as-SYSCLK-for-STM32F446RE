Target MCU - STM32F446RE
Language   - Embedded C
IDE         - Ac6 system workbench for STM32 - also can be imported to Atollic truestudio or STM32CubeIDE


 * A simple exercise in which I will use HSE to configure it as the SYSCLK as 8 MHz
 * AHB clk as 4Mhz
 * APB1 clk as 2 Mhz
 * APB2 clk as 2Mhz



->Here I have used TeraTerm as the Serial software to receive messages from the MCU on the PC.
1.Install teraterm
2.set the COM port to where your ST-Link is
3.Set the baud rate to 115200 bps
4.Press the RESET button your MCU to view the value of the CLOCKS.
